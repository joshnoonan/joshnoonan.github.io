title: Modeling Height and Average Shot Distance For Two Championship Teams
---

Data from nbaminer.com shows the average shot distance of an NBA team has radically changed from the 1996-97 season to today, the league leader in average shot distance in 1996-97 would be in last place in today's NBA. Analytics and players such as Steph Curry have driven a three point revolution, but what exactly does that look like on a player-by-player basis in comparing the Bulls and Warriors dynasties? Steph Curry and Steve Kerr have average shot distances in the average ballpark, but it doesn't take much basketball knowledge to know that Steph Curry is operating as the engine of the Warriors offense and taking significantly more shots than Steve Kerr. Players during the time of the 1996-98 Bulls were pigeonholed into roles as "three-point specialists", but one can look at the Warriors' players average shot charts and see that this is not the case. Kevin Durant, 6'9" at the very least (could very well be taller) has an average shot distance greater than all but two players on the 1996-98 Bulls. The shaded grey region in the upper right corner (taller players and longer average shot distances) of the Warriors shot chart is an area that does not even exist on the Bulls shot chart. This reveals how the three point revolution has permeated modern basketball; not only are players averaging longer shot distances, but taller players are shooting threes with a greater frequency. Gone are the days of back-to-the-basket post-ups and contested midrange jumpers, players both tall and short have decided to trade these shots for three pointers.
