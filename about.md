Hi! I'm Josh Noonan and I'm currently a sophomore at Williams College in Massachusetts. I'm a math major but have an interest in computer science, and  I'm interested in applications of math in the fields of finance, data analytics, and machine learning. On this website you'll find my personal work (a lot of which focuses on the NBA and analytics) and much of this work was completed in the summer of 2019 as I did research with a professor Tim Chartier of Davidson. I hope you find something of interest on this site, and feel free to reach out if you have any comments, questions, or advice!
